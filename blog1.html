    I tried every program possible to get in shape in my 30s, and I still looked like sh*t. <br>

I constantly had ‘projects’. Big Plans. <br>

Keto for 6 weeks. Powerlifting for 3 months. Cold showers for… well I didn’t last long with that one, to be honest. Brrrr. <br>

But this kind of short-termism is fine for folks in their 20s and 30s — they have time to mess up and learn. <br>

After 40 your body starts arguing with you a little, and the clock is ticking. Things don’t work as well as they once did, so you need to avoid wasting time on dumb stuff if you want to: <br>

 <li>get in shape</li>
<li>lose weight</li>
 <li>look and feel younger than your age</li> <br>

Look around you and you won’t see many folks over 40 in great shape and full of energy. Because 99% of people struggle to do something that can’t be found in their social media feeds and Google searches. <br>

It’s consistently turning up and doing the Minimum Effective Dose.
