Cut to my first day as a data analyst at this small, cozy company — the kind with mismatched office chairs and a coffee machine older than me. <br>

My boss, bless his heart, was old-school tech all the way. He hands me a stack of printouts and grins, “We need insights from this sales data. Welcome aboard!” Okay, maybe not the tech paradise I envisioned, but I was ready to impress. <br>

All those fancy machine learning models from school? Useless. It was Excel hell, and I was officially in over my head. <br>

Task 1: The Monster Pivot Table <br>
My first week went by in a blur of VLOOKUPs and pivot tables that stretched to the horizon. Then came the beast — a report so critical it fueled the entire company’s strategy.
